The player’s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape
chosing the shortest possible route.
- The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character.
- The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.
- The player should not be able to move into walls.
- At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.
- You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile)

Graphic management
- Your program has to display the image in a window.
- The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another win-
dow, minimizing, and so forth).
- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- Clicking on the cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the
program in a clean way.

Map
- The map has to be constructed with 3 components: walls, collectibles, and free
space.
- The map can be composed of only these 5 characters:\
0 for an empty space,\
1 for a wall,\
C for a collectible,\
E for a map exit,\
P for the player’s starting position.

Here is a simple valid map:\
1111111111111\
10010000000C1\
1000011111001\
1P0011E000001\
1111111111111

- The map must contain 1 exit, at least 1 collectible, and 1 starting position to
be valid.
If the map contains a duplicates characters (exit/start), you should
display an error message.
- The map must be rectangular.
- The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it’s not, the program must return
an error.
- You have to check if there’s a valid path in the map.
- You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the above rules.
- Another example of a minimal .ber map:\
1111111111111111111111111111111111\
1E0000000000000C00000C000000000001\
1010010100100000101001000000010101\
1010010010101010001001000000010101\
1P0000000C00C0000000000000000000C1\
1111111111111111111111111111111111

- If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must
exit in a clean way, and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of
your choice.
